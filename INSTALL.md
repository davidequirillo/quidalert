### Server (for admin)

(under construction)

## Developers only 

Install Git for Windows

[https://git-scm.com/install/windows]: https://git-scm.com/install/windows

Install VSCode IDE

[https://code.visualstudio.com/]: https://code.visualstudio.com/

[https://www.anaconda.com/download/success]: https://www.anaconda.com/download/success

On miniconda prompt (terminal), go to dynalert folder and write:

```
conda env create -f server/environment.yml
```

```
conda activate dynalert_env
```

### Debugging (run)

Clone repository 

Go to dynalert local folder and write the following command to open the entire project workspace with VS Code:

```
code .dynalert.code-workspace
```

NOTE: code workspace has been configured to ignore some useless folders from the programming IDE view (for example “build” directories)

To run (debug) client and server, go to VS Code menu -> View -> Run.
- Choose "Debug - Client (Flutter)" to debug the client and click to play
- Choose "Debug - Server (Python)" to debug the server and click to play

Obviously they can be executed together, in parallel, to test the entire system.
